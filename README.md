# Sinatra Large Application Template

This repo is a template for large applications based on sinatra.

This template looks to Rails for advice, and this structure is only a suggestion.

## File Structure

The structure is as follows:

```
|- config.ru
|- server.rb
|- app/
\--- routes/
\------ users.rb
\--- models/
\----- user.rb
\--- views/
\----- users/
\------- index.erb
\------- new.erb
\------- show.erb
......
```
